Dear [NAME],

On this special day, I want to take a moment to wish you a very happy birthday.
You have always been my guiding light, my source of inspiration, and my rock.
Your unwavering support and love mean the world to me, and
I'm so grateful for the countless lessons and memories you've shared with me throughout the years.
I hope this day is filled with joy, laughter, and all the things that bring a smile to your face.
May the year ahead be as amazing as you are.

Happy Birthday, Dad!
